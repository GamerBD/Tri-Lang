Tri-Lang üåç

Tri-Lang is a fun, retro-style language learning game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a passion project from Gamer BD, a game developer who loves old-school consoles like the Game Boy and retro games.

The game features my mascot, TriBlaze, a red triangle with cool retro sunglasses, who guides you through the lessons. You start by choosing a language like Spanish, French, or even Bangla. The game presents a "skill tree" of lessons, and for each lesson, you're given a word to translate and a few multiple-choice options.

Features:

Retro Aesthetics: The game has a simple, clean design with a red and white color scheme, giving it a classic, retro feel.

Multiple Languages: Learn basic greetings like "Hello," "Thank you," and "Goodbye" in several languages.

XP and Streak System: Track your progress with an experience point (XP) and streak counter.

Hearts System: You have three hearts per lesson. If you get an answer wrong, you lose a heart!

Interactive Mascot: Your guide, TriBlaze, is right there on the page to cheer you on.
